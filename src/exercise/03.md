# Lifting state

## 📝 Your Notes

J'ai appris l'importance pour la performance d'une applictaion React de placer
l'état d'un composant au plus proche de là où il est nécessaire.

Si un état doit être partagé entre plusieurs composants, alors on le place dans
leur parent commun le plus proche
([lifting state up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)).

```js
function App() {
  const [owner, setOwner] = React.usestate('') // State is lifted here
  const [dog, setDog] = React.usestate('') // State is lifted here

  return (
    <>
      <OwnerInput
        owner={owner}
        onOwnerChange={event => setOwner(event.target.value)}
      />
      <DogInput dog={dog} onDogChange={event => setDog(event.target.value)} />
      <Display owner={owner} dog={dog} /> {/* Shared state is used here */}
    </>
  )
}
```

Si un état n'est utile que pour un composant, il vaut mieux le placer
directement dans le composant, ce qui pourra améliorer la performance globale
d'une application en évitant de déclencher un rendu intégral de celle-ci
([colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

```js
function DogInput() {
  const [dog, setDog] = React.usestate('') // State is colocated here

  return <input value={dog} onChange={event => setDog(event.target.value)}>
}
function App() {
  const [owner, setOwner] = React.usestate('')

  return (
    <>
      <OwnerInput owner={owner} onOwnerChange={event => setOwner(event.target.value)} />
      <DogInput /> {/* We no longer need the dog state here so it's removed */}
      <Display owner={owner} /> {/* We no longer need the dog state here so it's removed */}
    </>
  )
}
```

## Background

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) which
basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the two
components and placing the state management there, and then passing the state
and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need it.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.js)
- [Final](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.js)

👨‍💼 Peter told us we've got a new feature request for the `Display` component. He
wants us to display the `animal` the user selects. But that state is managed in
a "sibling" component, so we have to move that management to the least common
parent (`App`) and then pass it down.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 colocating state

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.js)

As a community we’re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

👨‍💼 Peter told us that now users only want the animal displayed instead of the
name:

```javascript
function Display({animal}) {
  return <div>{`Your favorite animal is: ${animal}!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it. You know what you just did for the `Animal` component? You need to
do the opposite thing for the `Name` component.
